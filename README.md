### **Python with Machine Learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Block chain.**


1. Weather APP (Using API)

In This App I have used API of **openweather** and Given a list of Cities. The Program will Automatically Find the Hottest City and Show That City To us.

2. QR Code Scanner

In this app I have made an application which will automatically detects the message wriitten in QR Code.
And it will display that message above The QRCode.
Example Given Below.

3. Face Dectection

In this App I have Used features of OpenCV and Implemented The Face Detection App.

4. Web Scrapping

In this app I have used BeautifullSoup and collected the information Available on the Other's Website.

I have Scrapped text as well as Photos on two different Files.

5. Lane Dectection

In this app i have used the concept of detecting the lane present on the roadside,using this Code we will be able to detects the lanes presents on the road.

6. Project 6

In this App we have removed the red eye which is captured while we take phtos using Camera.

This App will help To remove the red eye portion from the eyes and make it look like normals eyes.

7. Weather App API using ML

In this I have used **openweather** api and given a graph for all the cities present in the List.

8. Iris Flower 

In this App i have used the concept of Iris Flower and performed all the basic Iris flower concept.

9. Salary predection

In this i have used the Dataset and perfrom Train Test and tried to predect the salary based on there exprience.

12. HamSpam Classifier \

In this app i have used HamSpam Classifier dataset and try to predect the message which have been arrived wheather it is Ham or Spam.

13. Hand_Written_Digits_MnistDataset - DL

In this app i have used the libaries of keras and some other libaries to predect the hand written Numbers.

14. German_Traffic_Sign_Classifier - DL

In this app i have used the Deep Learning Concept and its libraries to predect the Traffic sign Signals.

![Python_14](https://github.com/iamtiwarianurag/MLatLCO/blob/master/Project%2014/Graph1.png)

15. Self Driving Car

In this app i have used the Coursera Simulator and Deep Learning libraries and train a model to drive the car automatically without the help of Driver. The car will drive automatically based on the model trained.
